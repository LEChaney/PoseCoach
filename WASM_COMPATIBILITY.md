# WASM Compatibility Guide

## âœ… Current State - FULLY COMPATIBLE

The PoseTrainer app is now **fully compatible** with WebAssembly builds! All Flutter analyzer warnings have been fixed and the `file_system_access_api` dependency has been replaced with a custom WASM-compatible OPFS implementation.

## âœ… WASM Compatibility - SOLVED

**Issue Resolved**: The `file_system_access_api` package has been completely removed and replaced with a custom OPFS implementation using `package:web` and `dart:js_interop`.

## Build Options - Both Fully Supported

### Option 1: Standard Web Build
```bash
flutter build web
```
- âœ… Full OPFS functionality
- âœ… Efficient binary storage for drawings
- âœ… Faster build times
- âœ… Mature and stable

### Option 2: WASM Build
```bash
flutter build web --wasm
```
- âœ… **Full OPFS functionality** (Now supported!)
- âœ… WASM performance optimizations  
- âœ… Efficient binary storage for drawings
- âœ… Future-proof technology

## âœ… Implementation Details

### What Was Done (Approach 1 - Completed)

1. **Removed Dependencies:**
   - Removed `file_system_access_api: ^2.0.0` from `pubspec.yaml`
   - Replaced with `web: ^1.1.0` (already present)

2. **Created WASM-Compatible OPFS Implementation:**
   - Replaced `lib/services/binary_store_web.dart` with custom `dart:js_interop` implementation
   - Created proper JavaScript interop interfaces:
     - `FileSystemDirectoryHandle`
     - `FileSystemFileHandle` 
     - `FileSystemWritableFileStream`
     - Supporting option types
   - Updated `lib/services/storage_diagnostics_web.dart` to use new interfaces

3. **Maintained Full Functionality:**
   - All OPFS features preserved (read, write, delete, directory creation)
   - **Storage quota and usage information fully restored**
   - Proper error handling and fallback to Hive/IndexedDB
   - Debug logging maintained
   - Recursive directory operations supported

## Migration Status

âœ… **All Completed:**
- Fixed all deprecated Flutter APIs (surfaceVariant, withOpacity, Matrix4 transforms)
- **Fully migrated from dart:html and dart:js_util to package:web and dart:js_interop**
- **Replaced file_system_access_api with custom WASM-compatible implementation**
- Fixed null-aware assignment patterns
- Fixed BuildContext async usage
- Cleaned up unnecessary imports
- **Zero Flutter analyzer warnings**

## Build Test Results

- âœ… `flutter build web` - Success
- âœ… `flutter build web --wasm` - Success  
- âœ… `flutter analyze` - No issues found

## Recommended Usage

**For Production:** Both build targets are now fully supported. Choose based on your priorities:

- **Standard Web Build:** If you want the most mature and stable option
- **WASM Build:** If you want cutting-edge performance and future-proofing

**For Development:** Use standard web builds for faster iteration, WASM builds for performance testing.

## Technical Notes

The custom OPFS implementation:
- Uses proper `dart:js_interop` extension types for type safety
- Handles all Promise-based JavaScript APIs with `.toDart` conversions
- Maintains the same API contract as the original implementation
- Falls back gracefully to Hive/IndexedDB when OPFS is unavailable
- Is fully compatible with both standard JavaScript and WebAssembly compilation targets

**No workarounds needed - everything just works!** ðŸŽ‰
